# OAuth Authentication Process

This document describes the process for establishing OAuth clients in the system, validating a client to acquire a Bearer token, and using the token in a request.

## Implementation
OAuth functionality is provided by the [Drupal Simple OAuth module](https://www.drupal.org/project/simple_oauth). See the documentation provided by that module for general use.  The [linked YouTube video series on OAuth](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZOQ_ZMpYrZtqy5-o7KoDhM3n6M0duBjX) is especially helpful for those not familiar with OAuth processes.
